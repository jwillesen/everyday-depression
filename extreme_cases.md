# Extreme Cases

Depression and other mental disorders are something you hear about a lot these days. Robin Williams' suicide in August 2014 had a [lasting impact][hotlines] on suicide hotline services. The internet and social media have provided a new forum to talk about these issues openly. Jenny Lawson, [The Bloggess][bloggess], and Allie Brosh from [Hyperbole][hyperbole1] and a [Half][hyperbole2] are two examples that come to my mind. There's the semicolon tattoos, inspired by [Project Semicolon's][semicolon] founder, Amy Bleuel. There was even a talk at the [2013][mwrc2013] [Mountain West Ruby Conference][mwrc] by [Greg Baugues][bauges] where he talked about his own struggles with mental health.

Raising awareness of mental health is very important, and I appreciate the courageous people like these who share their struggles with the world. But I have one worry. The stories you hear about the most are the extreme cases. The stories where someone loses their job, or flunks out of school, or sabotages their relationships, or simply can't get out of bed. These are the kinds of events we associate with depression, but it's only part of the story.

[Carol Dweck's][dweck] book [Mindset][mindset] relates the story of a depressed college freshman. He sought the advice of a psychology teaching assistant, and the conversation went like this:

> "Are you going to your classes?"
>
> "Yes."
>
> "Are you keeping up with your reading?"
>
> "Yes."
>
> "Are you doing okay on your exams?"
>
> "Yes."
>
> "Well, then you're not depressed."

The notion that someone who is functioning must not be depressed is a dangerous one.
