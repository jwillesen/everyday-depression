# Spectrum

Many mental disorders have a spectrum of severity. There's a disorder related to depression called [dysthymia][dysthymia]. It's similar to depression, and while the symptoms aren't as severe, it's a chronic condition, meaning it lasts for a lifetime. There's also [Seasonal Affective Disorder][sad], a form of depression that's present only during the winter months.

Because someone's symptoms don't fall at the extreme end of the spectrum doesn't mean they aren't suffering. But their stories are not the ones you hear about. Before I did the research for this talk, I had never even heard of dysthymia.

It's for this reason that stories like [Wil Wheaton's][wheaton] are important. Wil wasn't severely depressed. He didn't think about suicide. But he was suffering. Eventually he sought help and his life improved. As he puts it:

> I suffered for no good reason for decades, until I couldn’t reconcile my awesome life with feeling terrible all the time.
> ...
> It’s like I was in a loud room for so long, I didn’t know how loud it was.

It's a quiet, non-dramatic story. It's not going to make headlines or get a million hits on YouTube. But it's far more representative of the millions of people out there who have a depressive disorder and don't know it. Who think their own feelings don't qualify because they're still functional.

Wil's story is the only one I know of that comes from somebody famous. We need to hear more stories like this. So, (and I'm sure most of you saw this coming) even though I'm not famous, I'm going to tell you my story.
