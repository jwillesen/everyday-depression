# Getting Help

It wasn't until December, 2014 that I finally decided to get help. In February, my eldest son turned 8. In July, I started a new role at work as a manager and team lead. And in August, our third child, our baby daughter, was born. It was a time of change and stress, and I felt myself slipping into the same depressive pattern I had when my two boys were born.

Earlier that year, my son told me something. He said, "You're a good dad. Even though you don't smile very much." I'm never going to forget that.

Even then, I didn't realize I had to do something. Awhile after I became a manager, my boss asked, "Are you enjoying your job?" And I had to explain to him about my depression. As a manager, you really have to be able to control your emotions. I realizd if I was going to succeed I needed to do something.  And I really wanted to succeed; it's a more satisfying position for me than being a full time developer.

But I still had a problem: I didn't know what to do. I knew I didn't want just talking therapy, but full fledged psychiatrists are expensive. I spent a lot of time trying to find one I liked, and trying to figure out how to fit it into my budget.

It wasn't until November that I got my answer. I was offsite with the other team leads getting some leadership training, and near the end we got some one-on-one time with the trainers. The trainer I chose to talk to happened to have quite a lot of experience dealing with depression. She suggested I go and see my general practitioner. Somehow, this thought had never occurred to me.

So I made an appointment in December. I was quite nervous about it. I was afraid she was going to tell me that I didn't really have the problems I thought I had. As it turned out, the appointment was rather simple. She asked me some specific questions about my symptoms and then wrote me a prescription for a drug called Sertraline. She told me to start slowly with half doses for 2 weeks, and it would take 6 to 8 weeks to see the full effects. I made a follow up appointment in February, filled my prescription, and for the first time in my life I started taking pills that weren't antibiotics.
