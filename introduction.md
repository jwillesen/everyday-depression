# Everyday Depression

Before I begin, I want to make it clear that this talk is about depression and other mental disorders. I know that talking about these things can be difficult for some people for wide variety of reasons. If anyone needs to leave now or later for any reason, I'm not going to be offended.

I also want to mention that this entire talk and presentation can be [found online][talk] with links to many of the resources and information I'll be citing.
