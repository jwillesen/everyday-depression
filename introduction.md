# Everyday Depression

Before I begin, I want to make it clear that this talk is about depression and other mental disorders. I know that talking about these things can be difficult for a lot of people for many reasons, so if anyone needs to leave now or later for any reason, I'm not going to be offended.

I also want to mention that this entire talk can [be found online][talk], which includes references
to all the information.
