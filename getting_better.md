# Getting Better

After the doctor's appointment, it felt really good to have taken a positive step towards feeling better. It was a surprisingly strong placebo effect, and I was a little worried I wouldn't be able to detect the difference the medication was having, if any.

Turns out it was an unjustified worry; 6 to 8 weeks is a long time, and it didn't take long for the temporary mood boost to wear off. But after 4 weeks, I started noticing my anger was decreasing; I had more patience with my children than I'd ever had before, and could talk to them rationally when they were causing trouble.

If that had been the only effect, I would have been totally satisfied with my treatment. But it kept getting better. And I had some emotional experiences I'd never had before. The best example I can give is on the subject of sighing.

Growing up, my family sighed a lot. Our sighs were always in irritation, frustration, or just plain tiredness. We often got on each other's nerves.

One day in February, about 8 weeks after I started taking pills, I was driving with my family, and I sighed. But it was a different kind of sigh. It was a sigh of satisfaction. A sigh of just being happy to be with my family. It was the first time in my life I'd sighed like that.

Other people started noticing changes in me as well. One of my wife's close friends asked about why I seemed so different. My wife explained to her about my treatment and the pills I was taking, and she said, "Really? It made that big a difference?"

My son, the same one who made the first comment I'll never forget, said something else that I'll never forget. He said, "Boy, Dad sure is in a good mood today." And it was true. I had never been as happy or as satisfied before in my life.

At my follow-up appointment with my doctor, I was happy to report how well things were going. "I had no idea how much I had been suffering all this time," I said. She told me that she thought my depression was genetic, possibly a strain that she called "Scandinavian Depression."[^1] She then refilled my prescription for a year, and said to schedule a follow-up for next year.
