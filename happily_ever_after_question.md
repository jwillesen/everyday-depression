# Happily Ever After?

I wish I could say that's the end of the story and things have been perfect since then. The truth is that as the summer progressed, my mood slowly declined. My doctor had told me that Sertraline eventually stops working, and you have to go off of it for awhile. We had planned to do this next summer, when the weather was good and people are generally happier, but the effects wore off for me faster than usual.

I noticed the decline near the end of summer, and I made an appointment with my doctor to discuss it with her. She told me that I needed to get on a regular exercise schedule, maybe explore therapy, and she prescribed me a second medication to take with the Sertraline. But this new medication did not work at all for me. It made it hard for me to sleep, and as I said before, that's really bad for depression.

I tried the new medication for a couple of months, thinking maybe it just needed time to kick in, even though my doctor said it should only take 2 weeks. But the decline continued. By November, I was pretty much back where I had started, and I knew that I had to make yet another appointment with my doctor. But I didn't. I told myself I kept putting it off because work was so busy, but the real reason was I didn't feel like it, and I couldn't motivate myself to do it.

One thing about depression is it makes even the simplest tasks seem impossible. What would normally be a small hill climb feels like scaling Mount Everest. It's discouraging, and you really don't want to do it. Logically, you _know_ it shouldn't be that hard, but _emotionally_ it really is that hard. And then you feel even worse because you can't even do something that should be simple.

One thing Jenny Lawson likes to say is, "[Depression Lies][depression_lies]." It really does. It lies to you about how hard things are. It lies to you about your capabilities. It lies to you about your self worth.

Just this January, this same month I'm giving this presentation, I finally realized I wasn't going to get help for myself. So I asked my wife to call the doctor for me. She was more than happy to help, and I'm grateful for the support she's given me through this whole ordeal. Things turned out a lot simpler than I had imagined. It turned out my doctor already had a backup plan, told me to stop the new medication, and prescribed something else for me to try. I didn't even have to go in to see her.

Like my old medication, which I still take, the new medication takes 6 to 8 weeks to reach its full effect. So I'm still waiting to see if it will help. But it feels really good to be taking another positive step. It's pretty clear to me that I have a chronic form of depression, and I'm probably going to be taking some sort of brain pills for the rest of my life. I'm okay with that. Like Wil Wheaton, I don't want to go back into that loud room. It might be something I'll have to struggle with regularly, but it will definitely be worth it.
