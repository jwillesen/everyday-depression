# What Depression Feels Like for Me

Men and women generally experience depression differently, and it's much more common with women. There are also variations among different people, but there are a lot of common [symptoms][]:

 * Persistent sad, anxious, or "empty" feelings
 * Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism
 * Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness
 * Irritability, restlessness
 * Loss of interest in activities or hobbies once pleasurable, including sex
 * Fatigue and decreased energy
 * Difficulty concentrating, remembering details, and making decisions
 * Insomnia, early-morning wakefulness, or excessive sleeping
 * Overeating, or appetite loss
 * Thoughts of suicide, suicide attempts
 * Aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems that do not ease even with treatment.

For me, these were the significant symptoms:

 * "empty" feelings
 * Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism
 * Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness
 * Irritability, restlessness
 * Loss of interest in activities or hobbies once pleasurable
 * Difficulty concentrating
 * Insomnia, early-morning wakefulness, or excessive sleeping
 * Thoughts of suicide
 * Aches or pains, headaches

Although "irritability" doesn't really cover it. For me, it was outright anger. And while I'm proud to say that I've never struck anyone, I'm ashamed to say my children have been yelled at much more than anyone ever deserves to be.

Many of you know how much I like boardgames -- I have over 300 in my collection. I know I'm in real trouble when even boardgames aren't interesting to me. Sometimes I'd find myself wandering around the house, peering into the refrigerator or pantry, and my wife would ask me, "What are you looking for?"

"Nothing," is what I would say, but the answer said to myself was "I'm looking for something to fill the empty space in my soul."

I know that I'm not going to commit suicide any time soon; I care too much about my family and children to do that to them. But that doesn't stop the negative thoughts from coming. Often when I'd go to sleep, I'd have a hope that I wouldn't wake up. That somehow it would all just be over.
For a long time, my life plan looked like this:

 - Work and raise children
 - Go die in a ditch

There were good days, of course. Sometimes good things would happen, or sometimes I just felt all right for no reason. But it would never last more than a day or two. Often it would just take one little thing going wrong, and my happy mental state would implode on itself.

I think the worst thing about my depression is the persistence of it. It takes constant diligence to keep monitoring yourself. To constantly watch your temper. To constantly redirect your thoughts when they get too dark.

It's a strange cognitive dissonance to know that you're depressed, to know the thoughts and feelings you're having are coming from the depression and not something external, and to not have any control over it whatsoever. You can't just snap out of it, or decide not to be depressed. It becomes a part of who you are, and resisting it takes constant effort.
