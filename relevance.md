# Relevance

You might think this is an unusual topic for Pandamonium.[^1] But I think this topic is particularly relevant to Instructure employees. Instructure focuses on hiring the best: the smartest and most creative people we can find. There are [some studies][smart-studies] that _may_ show a correlation between intelligence and creativity with depression and bipolar disorder.

There's also some [truth][progammer-sleep1] to the [stereotype][progammer-sleep2] of the technical guru who's up late at night hacking away on their latest obsession. Not getting enough sleep will [increase depressive symptoms][sleep-depression].

For those of us who work at Instructure's home base in Utah, [Mental Health America][mha] routinely ranks states on their mental health using a variety of metrics. Utah tends to [rank pretty low][states] on those lists, although no one really knows why.
