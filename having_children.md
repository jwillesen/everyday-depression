# Having Children

After my wife and I bought our first home, we did something we were totally unprepared for: we decided to have children. I don't know if other parents feel the same way, but for me, having children is the hardest thing I have ever done, or will ever do, in my life. And the problems never get any easier; they just change into other problems.

My wife's first pregnancy was not an easy one. We had a lot of extra doctor's appointments to go to, and my wife needed extra help around the house. And as my stress level grew higher, my mood grew worse. In an effort to save some time, money, and stress, I stopped going to my martial arts classes. Which, in retrospect, was a big mistake since [exercise][] is one of the best things you can do for depression.

I never really recovered from the shock of having children. Partly because children are a constant source of stress, and partly because we decided to have more than one.[^1] I was also going through a string of jobs that I hated.[^2] In retrospect, the depression probably had a great deal to do with my work attitude. After my first child was born, my boss at the time commented, "You just seem so angry all the time." Turns out this was a pretty accurate description of what I felt like.

[^1]: You might be wondering, if having children is so hard, why did we decide to keep having them? The answer is: If you can pull it off, it is totally worth it.
[^2]: Pro tip: never work as a government contractor.
