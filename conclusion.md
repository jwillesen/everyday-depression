# Conclusion

After I had written down my story, I realized it sounded pretty dramatic. For me it was pretty dramatic. But as far as my life is concerned, I've been pretty successful. I have a college degree, a successful marrige, a really great job, and three wonderful children. I'm grateful I didn't turn to alcohol or drugs to self-medicate. In fact, my life is pretty ordinary, and I haven't suffered any real disasters. Even during the worst of times, I got out of bed and did what I had to do.

And really my story does have a happy ending. Even though I will struggle with depression the rest of my life, I know what I need to do and I have the support of my family when I need it. I'm going to live longer, I'm going to be happier, and hopefully I'll be more productive and do a better job than before.

To get back to the main point of my talk, even though I have a great life, like the college student in Carol Dweck's book, it didn't mean I wasn't suffering. And there are so many people out there who aren't getting help and are suffering needlessly.

This talk was a real struggle for me to write. I wasn't sure I wanted to share my weaknesses with everyone. But if just one person decides to get help as a result of this talk, then it was worth it. If any of you need help, please get it. If anyone you know or love is depressed, talk to them about it. Listen to them, don't discount their feelings, and know that this is a real problem. And please encourage them to get help. If you ever hear of anyone threatening to commit suicide, take it seriously, and ask them not to. If a crisis is about to occur, call 911.

Not all stories of mental disorders are disasters. In most cases they are invisible diseases, carefully tucked away by people who have a lifetime of practice acting like everything's normal. Many of them think the suffering _is_ normal. It's not. Life is so much better than that.

I wish good mental health for all of you. Thanks for listening.
