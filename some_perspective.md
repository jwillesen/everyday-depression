# Some Perspective

To start, I want to share some [statistics][stats] about depression,[^1] and then I want to tell you why I'm talking about it here today.

Depression affects roughly 14.8 million American adults, about 6.7% of the population. It's responsible for two-thirds of the 30,000 suicides each year. Two-thirds of people suffering from depression either don't seek or don't receive proper treatment. And that is particularly sad because 80% of people treated for depression see improvement in 4 to 6 weeks. And of that remaining 20% that don't improve, half of that happens because people don't follow through on their treatment plans.

## Relevance?

You might think this is an unusual topic for Pandamonium.[^2] But I think this topic is particularly relevant to Instructure employees. Instructure focuses on hiring the best: the smartest and most creative people we can find. There are [some studies][smart-studies] that _may_ show a correlation between intelligence and creativity with depression and bipolar disorder. 

There's also some [truth][progammer-sleep1] to the [stereotype][progammer-sleep2] of the technical guru who's up late at night hacking away on their latest obsession. Not getting enough sleep will [increase depressive symptoms][sleep-depression].

For those of us who work at Instructure's home base in Utah, [Mental Health America][mha] routinely ranks states on their mental health using a variety of metrics. Utah tends to [rank pretty low][states] on those lists, although no one really knows why.

Depression and other mental conditions are often referred to as disorders, but today I'd also like to look at it as a disability. Steve Townsend, our awesome VP of engineering, often makes the distinction between a _handicap_ and a _disability_. He's paralyzed and can't walk; he has to use a wheelchair to get around. So he has a disability. But at Instructure it's not a handicap; he can get around and work just fine here. Just like not being able to speak Spanish or Italian or Russian isn't a handicap for the rest of us in our work.

So if we look at depression as a disability, is it also a handicap here at Instructure? Our company has an amazing mission: we write software that makes people better. What if you don't have the ability to be motivated by that mission? We talk a lot about ownership and passion. What if you can't be passionate? What if you can't enjoy, or even take pride in, the work you do? How much does that handicap you at work?

I don't have a definitive answer to those questions, but I do know there is an economic cost to depression. Because depression often co-exists with other conditions, it's hard to suss out the costs of depression versus the cost of the other conditions. But to examine just one aspect, [a study][presenteeism] shows that in 2010, "presenteeism"[^3] caused by Major Depressive Disorder alone cost employers $78 billion. And because so many people who suffer from depression go untreated, these costs are much higher than they need to be.
