# Some Perspective

I want to start with some [statistics][stats] about depression.[^1] It affects roughly 14.8 million American adults (or 6.7% of the population), and is reponsible for two-thirds of the 30,000 suicides each year. In addition, two-thirds of people suffering from depression don't seek or don't receive proper treatment, which is particularly sad because 80% of people treated for depression see improvement in 4 to 6 weeks.


## Why is this relevant?

You might think this is an unusual topic for Pandamonium.[^2] But I think this topic is particularly relevant to Instructure employees. Instructure focuses on hiring the best: the smartest and most creative people we can find. There are [some studies][smart-studies] that _may_ show a correlation between intellengence and creativity with depression and bipolar disorder. There's also some truth to the stereotype of the technical guru who's up late at night hacking away on their latest obsession. Not getting enough sleep will [increase depressive symptoms][sleep-depression].

Also, for those of us who work at Instructure's home base, [Mental Health America][mha] routinely ranks states on their mental health using a variety of metrics, and Utah tends to [rank pretty low][states] on those lists, although no one really knows why.
