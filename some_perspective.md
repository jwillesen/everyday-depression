# Some Perspective

To start, I want to share some [statistics][stats] about depression,[^1] and then I want to tell you why I'm talking about it here today.

Depression affects roughly 14.8 million American adults, about 6.7% of the population. It's responsible for two-thirds of the 30,000 suicides each year. Two-thirds of people suffering from depression either don't seek or don't receive proper treatment. And that is particularly sad because 80% of people treated for depression see improvement in 4 to 6 weeks. And of that remaining 20% that don't improve, half of that happens because people don't follow through on their treatment plans.

There's also an economic cost to depression. Because depression often co-exists with other conditions, it's hard to suss out the costs of depression versus the cost of the other conditions. But to examine just one aspect, [a study][presenteeism] shows that in 2010, "presenteeism"[^2] caused by Major Depressive Disorder alone cost employers $78 billion. Compare this to the $69 billion in [lost productivity from diabetes][diabetes-cost]. The highest estimate I could find for the [_total_ cost of asthma][asthma-cost] was $56 billion.

You wouldn't expect someone with diabetes or asthma to go untreated. But so many people who suffer from depression do. Which means these costs are much higher than they need to be.
