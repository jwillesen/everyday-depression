# First Episode

When I was in 8th Grade, I was called into the school counselors office. I had been acting particularly mopey in school and my French teacher was worried. I don't remember the conversation that led up to it, but at one point the counselor asked me outright, "Have you been thinking about suicide?"

"Not seriously," I said. Which was an honest answer; if I had been serious I would have done it already. The full truth was I had a plan. I knew where my grandfather kept his guns. It wouldn't be easy to get to them, but I knew with a dedicated effort I could if I had to. It was a macabre sort of comfort, knowing that I had an out if things got bad enough.

I imagine that Junior High School is the worst possible environment for teenagers. It's a place filled with children who are old enough to know how to be truly dangerous and aren't mature enough to restrain themselves. I wasn't bullied severely, just enough to hate going to school. This was the first major depressive episode I remember, although I didn't know it at the time. I think it was the school environment that triggered it. The depression lasted all through Junior High School.

There were two main reasons I didn't commit suicide back then. The first was the difficulty in carrying out my plan. And the second was that I knew how much my family loved me and would be sad if I was gone.

High School was a much better environment for me. There's a higher maturity level, and students are more separated into ability levels. College was even better, and after that I started my career as a programmer and got married. I played racquetball and taking a martial arts class, which meant I was exercising regularly. Everything was going perfectly and life was awesome; I was the happiest then that I ever remember being.
